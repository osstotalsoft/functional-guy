# Chapter2. The foundation

## Goals
  The goals of this chapter is to understand why functional programming matters and get acquainted with Haskell.
  
  After completing this chapter one should be able to:
  - Explain the advantages of functional programming
  - Install Haskell via Platform or Stack
  - Compile a Haskell source file with GHC
  - Play with GHCI (quit, load a source file, import a module, evaluate expressions, check the type of an expression, time function application)
  - Define named and annonymous functions
  - Understand higher order functions
  - Understand closures and lexical scope
  - Understand currying and partial application
  - List data structure and functions
  - Recursion and pattern matching
  - Abstracting recursion with List hof's
