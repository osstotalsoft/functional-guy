# Chapter2. Haskell's Type System

## Goals
After completing this chapter one should be able to:
 - recognize the built-in data types
 - define new types using: type synonims, function types, sum types, product types and record syntax 
 - explain the algebraic nature of types
 - recognize some common type classes
 - define new type classes, instances and deriving them
 - understand and use function composition
 - understand and use guards
 - understand the Semigroup and Monoid algebraic structures and type-classes
 - understand generic types
 - have some ideea about data kinds
 - model partial functions with the Maybe type
