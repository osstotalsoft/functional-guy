# Chapter6. Computational effects

<img src="logo.jpg" height="300" />

## Goals
- Understand the notions of computational effects
- Understand the difference between side-effects and computational (monadic) effects
- Expand our language with the terms: values with (computational) (monadic) effects, effectfull functions or functions with monadic effects
- Understand the practical value of:
    - Maybe effect - partial computations
    - Reader effect - read only state
    - State effect - read / write state
    - Writter effect - write-only state
    - List effect - nondetetrministic computations
    - IO effect - I/O computations
