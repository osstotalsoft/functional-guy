##### Functional Programming Guild for Great Good!
<img src="logo.png" width="200" height="200" />

*Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?*

## General
The goal of this guild members is to learn the fp paradigm and not a speciffic programming language.
Members of this guild will use the principles of fp paradigm in various programming languages like:
  - Haskell
  - Lisp
  - F#
  - C#
  - Scala
  - Clojure
  - JavaScript
  - Elm
  - Go
  - Rust

Because we all need a common language to communicate and share ideas we will learn and embrace the following languages:
  - Lambda Calcullus
  - Haskell
  - Category Theory

During our meetings and presentations we will try to connect our ideas with implementations (where possible) with other programming languages.
