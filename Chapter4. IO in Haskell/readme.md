# Chapter4. I/O in Haskell

## Goals
After completing this chapter four, you'll be able to:
 - Understand how Haskell handles I/O by using IO types
 - Use do-notation to perform I/O(Understanding of the underlying monad theory is not necessary to program using the I/O system)
 - Write pure programs that interact with the real world
 - Access command-line arguments
 - Use the traditional approach to interacting through I/O
 - Write I/O code using lazy evaluation to make I/O easier
 - Work with file handles in Haskell
 - Read from and write to files
