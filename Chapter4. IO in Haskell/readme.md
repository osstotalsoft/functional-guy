# Chapter4. I/O in Haskell

## Goals
After completing this chapter four, you'll be able to:
 - Understand how Haskell handles I/O by using IO types
 - Use do-notation to perform I/O(Understanding of the underlying monad theory is not necessary to program using the I/O system)
 - Write pure programs that interact with the real world
