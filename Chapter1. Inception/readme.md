# Chapter1. Inception

## Goals
  The goal of this chapter is to learn some of the history of Effective Computability and understand the two most important models of computation: the Turing Machine and the Lambda Calculus

  After completing this chapter one should understand:
  - Lambda Calculus as a formal system for expressing programs
  - the substitution model for function application
  - applicative vs normal evaluation order
  - Church encoding for booleans and numerals
