# Church Numerals
Church numerals are the representations of natural numbers under Church encoding. The higher-order function that represents natural number n is a function that maps any function f to its n-fold composition.

```
zero  = λf.λx.x
one   = λf.λx.fx
two   = λf.λx.f(fx)
three = λf.λx.f(f(fx))
```

You can recover normal integer by applying the church numerals functions to the succ function and 0.

```
succ  = λx.x+1
show = λn.n(λx.x+1)0

show one = (λn.n(λx.x+1)0)(λf.λx.fx)
         = (λf.λx.fx)(λx.x+1)0
         = (λx.(λx.x+1)x)0
         = (λx.x+1)0
         = 0+1
         = 1
```

## Combinators
```
add  = λm.λn.λf.λx.mf(nfx)
succ = λn.λf.λx.f(nfx)
pred = λn.λf.λx.n(λg.λh.h(gf))(λu.x)(λu.u)
mult = λm.λn.λf.λx.m(nf)x
```

## Exercises
```
one add two   = ...
two mult one  = ...
```
