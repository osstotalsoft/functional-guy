# Church pairs
Church pairs are the Church encoding of the pair (two-tuple) type. The pair is represented as a function that takes a function argument. When given its argument it will apply the argument to the two components of the pair. The definition in lambda calculus is,
```
pair = λx.λy.λz.zxy
fst  = λp.p(λx.λy.x)
snd  = λp.p(λx.λy.y)
```

## Exercises:
```
fst (pair a b) = ...
snd (pair a b) = ...
```
