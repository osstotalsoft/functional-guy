# Church Booleans
Church Booleans are the Church encoding of the Boolean values true and false. Some programming languages use these as an implementation model for Boolean arithmetic; examples are Smalltalk and Pico.

Boolean logic may be considered as a choice. The Church encoding of true and false are functions of two parameters:
- true chooses the first parameter.
- false chooses the second parameter.

```
true  = λa.λb.a
false   = λa.λb.b
```
Let's write an if-then-else function using this booleans:
```
ifte  = λc.λt.λe.cte

ifte true = (λc.λt.λe.cte)(λa.λb.a)xy
          = (λt.λe.(λa.λb.a)te)xy
          = λt.λe.(λb.t)e
          = λt.λe.t
          = true

ifte false = false
```

## Combinators
```
and = λp.λq.pqp
or  = λp.λq.ppq
```
