# Church lists
A list is either empty, or consists of a head (any lambda expression) and a tail (another list).
```
type List_of a = Nil | Cons a List_of a

Nil  = λn.λc. n
Cons h t = λn.λc. c h t

```

## Examples
```
[]      = Nil
[1]     = Cons 1 Nil
[1,2,3] = Cons 1 (Cons 2 (Cons 3 Nil))
```

## Combinators
### Right fold
foldr reducer initial = λf. f initial reducer


## Exercises:
```
fst (pair a b) = ...
snd (pair a b) = ...
```
